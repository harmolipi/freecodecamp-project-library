# [Personal Library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/personal-library)

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

## Functionality

This is the [Personal Library Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/personal-library) project, where I make an API that allows you to view, create, update, and delete books and comments associated with those books.

## Thoughts

The project itself was not very difficult, and the same as the other API projects so far. The most time-consuming part was figuring out what exact error messages and status codes the FCC tests were looking for - but otherwise, it's a simple CRUD API.

So with that done, the rest was a pretty simple CRUD API.

God bless.
